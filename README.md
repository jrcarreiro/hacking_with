# 📚 Hacking With...

This repository contains examples, tools, and practical exercises inspired by the book **Hacking with Go**, reimplemented in **Ruby** and **Swift**, with a focus on **offensive security**.

But this is not just a code dump. This is a real learning journey — and you’re invited to follow along.

## ✍️ Why This Project Exists

This project is part of my **personal learning path** in offensive security. I’ve been inspired by *Hacking with Go*, and instead of just reading or copying code, I’m rebuilding everything from scratch in **Ruby** and **Swift**.

> ✅ I’m using ChatGPT as a mentor — not to generate the answers, but to guide me through concepts and help me structure the project while I learn each piece for real.

Everything here is:
- Written with understanding
- Explained in simple, beginner-friendly language
- Organized as if it were ready for production

## 🧱 Project Structure

The project is split into three language tracks, following the same structure and topics in each:

```
hacking_with/
├── ruby/       # Ruby scripts and modules (with bin/ and lib/)
├── swift/      # Swift project using Swift Package Manager (SPM)
└── swiftc/     # Direct Swift scripts compiled with swiftc (no package)
```

Each chapter is written independently in all three versions, and includes modular code, clear examples, and CLI-ready scripts.

## 🔧 Project Roadmap: What This Series Covers

This series is about rebuilding the concepts from *Hacking with Go* in both Ruby and Swift, with a focus on **clean scripting**, **offensive tooling**, and **explaining everything with clarity**.

### 🧭 Here’s what the series covers:

1. **Development Environment** – setting up Ruby and Swift for CLI scripting  
2. **Language Fundamentals** – variables, types, functions, control structures  
3. **Useful Packages** – parsing, automation, colors, output  
4. **Networking** – TCP, UDP, proxies, SSH, scanning  
5. **File Parsing** – analyzing file formats for recon and analysis  
6. **Fuzzing** – writing simple fuzzers to test and break things  

Each chapter includes:

- ✅ Idiomatic code in both Ruby and Swift  
- ✅ Clean, versioned commits  
- ✅ CLI-focused scripts (no frameworks)  
- ✅ Real-world analogies that even non-programmers can understand

---

## 🔧 Requirements

- Ruby **3.3.5** (via rbenv or rvm)
- Swift **6.1** (via Xcode or official binaries)
- macOS or Linux with Swift support

```

## 🚀 Learning in Public

This project is helping me learn by building. I’m organizing everything as if I were teaching it to someone else — because that’s how I best learn myself.

Every file, method, and script is written with this principle:

> *“I’m not trying to impress. I’m trying to understand — and share that understanding clearly.”*
